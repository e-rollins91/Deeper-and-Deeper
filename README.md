# Deeper-and-Deeper-GameJam
 
Theme of game jam was 'Deeper and Deeper', with an endless theme.

The idea was a 4 player coop arena top down action fighter with little wizards, the networking was able to get working but I didn't get anything beyond basic enemy AI and a single rock attack that could be charged up.
